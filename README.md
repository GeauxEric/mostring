# MoString ðŸ”¥
variations over StringBuilder ideas in Mojo

## Demo

```python
from mostring import MoString

fn main():
    
    var text = MoString("Alice:")
    print(text.info())

    text+=" If I had"
    print(text.info())

    text.string +=" a world on my own"
    print(text.info())

    text+=", everything would be nonsense."
    print(text.info())

    text.optimize_memory()
    print(text.info())
```

Output:

```bash
Alice:
(Size: 6+1, Capacity: 7)

Alice: If I had
(Size: 15+1, Capacity: 28)

Alice: If I had a world on my own
(Size: 33+1, Capacity: 34)

Alice: If I had a world on my own, everything would be nonsense.
(Size: 64+1, Capacity: 68)

Alice: If I had a world on my own, everything would be nonsense.
(Size: 64+1, Capacity: 65)
```
